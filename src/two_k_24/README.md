## Challenge 1
- Only contains tasks (a) to (f) from the original challenge.
- I tried to keep the original signatures the same (for example, `delete` requires that we return a new rope, not modify the original). So, you could encounter occasional cloning, but it should not be hard to refactor the code to use `&mut` if needed.
