# 2012

## Challenge 1
- Uses a solution similar to Key & KIV team's solution from 2012, except with an additional lemma. The proof could probably be improved with better handling of triggers (because the original solution did not need the additional lemma/equivalence of definition between the loop LCP <==> forall definition. There might be a way to avoid this additional proof in Verus as well).

## Challenge 2
- The solution is based on [KEY team's solution from 2012](https://formal.kastel.kit.edu/~bruns/VerifyThis/). 
- Has a lot of assumptions. See the TODO comments in the code to see what exactly needs to be proven.
