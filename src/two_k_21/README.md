# 2021

## Challenge 1
- There are solutions to tasks 1, 4, 6.
- Tasks 2 and 5 have partial solutions.
- NOTE: This solutions is a direct translation from VerCors Team Blue's solution. All proof ideas and loop invariants and assertions are theirs: https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/blob/dev/examples/verifythis/2021/TeamBlue/Challenge1.pvl


## Challenge 3
- The solutions are taken from the [Why3 team, YYY (Jean-​Christophe Filliâtre and Andrei Paskevich)](https://verifythis.github.io/onsite/archive/2021/). I only translated the solutions to Verus.
- There are solutions to tasks 1, 2, and 3. This means that only the non-parallel version of the challenge is implemented.
